# Replit Prompt: Enhance Vape Cave Website for Local SEO and User Engagement

**Project Goal:** Optimize the Vape Cave website for local search visibility, user engagement, and clear calls to action.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Local SEO Optimization:**
    * Enhance schema markup (LocalBusiness schema) with detailed and accurate information, including business name, address, phone number (NAP), hours of operation, and services offered.
    * Ensure consistent NAP across all website pages and online directories.
    * Optimize location pages with unique, location-specific content, including details about the store's atmosphere, offerings, and community involvement.
    * Ensure the website is mobile-friendly and loads quickly.
2.  **Google Maps Optimization:**
    * Embed Google Maps iframes on location pages, displaying the exact store locations.
    * Include "Get Directions" links on location pages, directing users to Google Maps for easy navigation.
3.  **Clear Calls to Action (CTAs):**
    * Implement clear and compelling CTAs on the homepage, location pages, and product pages.
    * Examples: "Visit Our Store," "Get Directions," "Shop Now," "Contact Us," "Sign up for our newsletter".
    * Create a pop-up modal that appears on the homepage after a short delay (e.g., 10 seconds) or when the user intends to exit the page.
        * The pop-up should include:
            * A clear headline: "Get 15% Off Storewide!"
            * A field for the user to enter their email address.
            * A "Submit" button.
            * A clear message indicating that by signing up, they agree to receive promotional emails (ensure compliance with privacy laws).
        * Upon successful email submission:
            * Generate a unique discount code.
            * Display the discount code to the user.
            * Store the email address, discount code, timestamp, and date in a database or JSON file.
4.  **Informational and Engaging Content:**
    * Create a new page titled "Vaping Information" or similar, containing:
        * Vaping basics for beginners.
        * Safety tips and best practices.
        * Information about local vaping regulations.
        * News and updates about Vape Cave.
    * Establish a blog structure for future content creation.
5.  **Technical SEO:**
    * Ensure `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` files are up-to-date and accurate.
    * Create an image sitemap.
    * Ensure that the website is fast.
6.  **Admin Dashboard:**
    * Create a protected admin page accessible via a username and password.
    * The admin dashboard should display:
        * Website analytics (e.g., page views, unique visitors, traffic sources).
        * A table or list of all email sign-ups, including email addresses, discount codes, timestamps, and dates.
        * A button or link to download the email sign-up data as a CSV or JSON file.
7.  **Code Management System (Employee Access):**
    * Create a separate employee login page with username and password authentication.
    * Upon successful login, employees should be able to:
        * Enter a discount code.
        * Scan a QR code.
        * Mark the code as "used" in the database or JSON file.
        * The system should prevent used codes from being used again.
8.  **Data Storage:**
    * Choose a suitable method for storing data (e.g., a simple JSON file, a lightweight database like SQLite, or a more robust database like PostgreSQL if you anticipate significant growth).
    * Ensure data is stored securely and in compliance with privacy regulations.
9.  **Analytics:**
    * Integrate a basic analytics solution (e.g., using Google Analytics or a simple custom implementation) to track website traffic.
10. **Security:**
    * Implement strong password hashing for admin and employee logins.
    * Protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
11. **Time and Date Stamps:**
    * Implement accurate time and date stamps for all email sign-ups and code usage records.

**Important Notes:**

* Replace all placeholder content with actual business information.
* Ensure compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.
* Prioritize user experience and create valuable content.
* Thoroughly test all implemented features.
