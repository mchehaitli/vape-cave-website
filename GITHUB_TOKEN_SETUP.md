# ðŸ”‘ GitHub Token Setup for Push

## The Issue
GitHub requires a Personal Access Token instead of your password for authentication.

## Quick Fix - Create GitHub Token:

### Step 1: Create Token
1. Go to GitHub.com â†’ Click your profile picture â†’ Settings
2. Scroll down to "Developer settings" (left sidebar)
3. Click "Personal access tokens" â†’ "Tokens (classic)"
4. Click "Generate new token" â†’ "Generate new token (classic)"
5. Give it a name: "Netlify Deployment"
6. Set expiration: "90 days" (or longer)
7. **Check these permissions:**
   - âœ… repo (full repository access)
   - âœ… workflow (if you want GitHub Actions)
8. Click "Generate token"
9. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Push with Token
In your Replit Shell, run:

```bash
# Remove the old remote
git remote remove origin

# Add remote with your username and token
git remote add origin https://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/mchehaitli/vape-cave-website.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace:
- `YOUR_USERNAME` with: `mchehaitli`
- `YOUR_TOKEN` with the token you just created

## Alternative: Use SSH (More Secure)
If you prefer SSH keys, follow GitHub's SSH setup guide instead.

## After Success
Your code will appear in GitHub and you can continue with Netlify deployment!
